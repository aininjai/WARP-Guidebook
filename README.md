# AI-Native Terminal Study Pack

AI-native terminal study pack: guides, essays, and a reproducible Warp + AI CLI project that turns code-by-prompt development into a real workflow.

---

## Overview

This repository collects a small “AI Ninja Labs” bundle of materials on **AI in the development environment**, centered around the terminal:

- Strategic essay on **Warp vs. standalone CLI models** for AI-assisted development.
- A **study guide** with quiz, answer key, essay prompts, and glossary.
- A narrative case study of **“vibe coding”** a real medication-tracking CLI in Warp.
- A **single-run reproduction prompt** for rebuilding that CLI project from scratch.

The goal: help developers, power users, and AI-curious engineers think clearly about the “code-by-prompt” world—and give them a concrete, reproducible project to practice in their own terminal.

---

## Who This Is For

- Developers experimenting with **Warp**, **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, and other AI-assisted tools.
- Technical founders, DevOps people, and power users who live in the terminal.
- Educators and trainers looking for structured material on **AI in dev workflows**.
- Anyone curious about turning **AI chat + CLI** into a durable, reproducible workflow rather than a one-off prompt.

## Contents

- **`The Terminal as the New AI Frontier A Strategic Analysis of Warp vs. Standalone CLI Models.md`**  
  A long-form essay on the strategic landscape of AI-native development:  
  - Warp as an **agentic development environment**.  
  - Standalone CLIs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) as a **modular, sovereign toolkit**.  
  - How to stack both into a hybrid workflow for serious teams.  

- **`Study Guide AI in the Development Environment.md`**  
  A self-contained study pack including:  
  - Short-answer quiz + answer key.  
  - Essay questions for deeper analysis.  
  - A glossary of key terms (agents, context files, Warp Drive, etc.).  

- **`tramadol_story.md`**  
  A narrative “lab notebook” written from the perspective of **Warp** itself.  
  It walks through building a real project—a medication tracking CLI—with:  
  - Named sessions, annotated command blocks, and split panes.  
  - Chart generation, HTML reporting, reminders, and AI-powered analysis.  
  - A concrete example of **“vibe coding”** with AI as a collaborator.  

- **`tramadol_project_prompt.md`**  
  A **single-run spec** that explains exactly how to reproduce the Tramadol CLI project:  
  - Directory layout and file responsibilities.  
  - CLI behavior and analysis logic.  
  - Chart generation, HTML outputs, cron-based reminders, and AI deep analysis.  
  Treat this as a deterministic implementation
